# Landslide Hazard Assessment Tool (LHAT) #

LHAT is a landslide hazard assessment tool that utilises various machine learning
methods to produce a landslide susceptibility map. The map has a number of required inputs such as:

* Digital Elevation Model (and derived products such as slope, topographical position index, aspect)
* Land-use map
* Detailed lithology map

Users can optionally add in extra inputs to test potential causal relations between other factors and landslide susceptibility
